        There is a reason the Japanese have a mean age much higher than those of 
        other countries: their diets are very healthy! A staple food of the Japanese culture 
        is sushi. Sushi comes in many forms, but at its base it is sticky white rice packaged closely
        with raw fish, such as salmon or tuna. Not all sushi has fish though, some have egg, eel or other 
        base ingredients. Nevertheless,much of the sushi you might eat has fish, rice, and often 
        seaweed. Many dishes come with vegetables, different sauces, etc.
