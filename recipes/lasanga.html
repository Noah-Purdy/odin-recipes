        Lasagna is a classic Italian baked dish featuring layers of wide pasta 
        sheets, savory meat sauce with onions and garlic, a blend of cheeses 
        including ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan, and often a velvety bechamel sauce. 
        Seasoned with herbs like oregano and basil, the layers are baked until the 
        pasta is tender and the cheese is golden and bubbling. It's a hearty and 
        flavorful comfort food, appreciated for its rich taste and satisfying texture.</p>
